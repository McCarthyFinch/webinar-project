# Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where agents learn to make decisions by interacting with an environment.

## Key Concepts
1. **Agent**: The learner/decision maker
2. **Environment**: The world the agent interacts with
3. **State**: Current situation
4. **Action**: What the agent can do
5. **Reward**: Feedback from the environment

## Common Algorithms
- Q-Learning
- Deep Q Networks (DQN)
- Policy Gradient Methods
- Actor-Critic Methods

## The RL Process
```
State → Agent → Action → Environment → Reward → New State
  ↑                                              |
  └──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Real-World Applications
1. Game Playing (AlphaGo, OpenAI Five)
2. Robotics
3. Resource Management
4. Autonomous Vehicles

## Challenges
- Exploration vs Exploitation
- Credit Assignment
- Sample Efficiency
- State Space Complexity
