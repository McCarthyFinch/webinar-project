# Introduction to Neural Networks

Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks in human brains.

## Key Components
1. **Neurons**: Basic computational units
2. **Layers**:
   - Input Layer
   - Hidden Layers
   - Output Layer
3. **Weights and Biases**

## Common Applications
- Image Recognition
- Natural Language Processing
- Speech Recognition
- Game Playing

## Basic Architecture
```
Input Layer → Hidden Layer(s) → Output Layer
     ↓              ↓              ↓
[x1, x2, x3] → [h1, h2, h3, h4] → [y1, y2]
```

## Learning Process
1. Forward Propagation
2. Error Calculation
3. Backpropagation
4. Weight Updates
