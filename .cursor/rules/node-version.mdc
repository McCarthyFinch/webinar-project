# node, npm
When the user starts a new terminal session and the command is about to use node or npm

- Check for the existence of a `.nvmrc` file.
- If the `.nvmrc` file doesn't exist, create one with the desired Node.js version.  Once created proceed with the next step.
- If the `.nvmrc` file does exist always use the `nvm use (correct version specified in the .nvmrc file) && ` in front of the command, to switch to the node version specified in the `.nvmrc` file.  Eg: ```nvm use (correct version specified in the .nvmrc file) && npm install```
